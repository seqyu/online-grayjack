# Online Grayjack

## A lil' refresh about Blackjack's rule
Blackjack is a pretty fun game often played in casinos where the goal is to be the player with the highest possible score. Max is 21, if you go over 21, you lose your bet.

You start by placing your bets, then the dealer gives you 2 cards.

You can chose to either get more cards, don't get more, or just fold if you feel like you are going to lose.

## Grayjack Rules

## How Grayjack was born
It all started 175 years ago, in Le Grand Cercle casino in France. No actually it was just a regular tuesday afternoon on the 24th of june 2025.

I was playing Blackjack with a friend and he came up with an idea, being able to see your cards during the betting phase. I found this idea amazing and we played with it.

A few hands later I was in bad posture and decided to fold, and I came up with another rule to try and make the game a bit more interesting, you can only fold once per game, not per hand, to prevent abusing the folding mechanic.

At this very moment, the idea of Grayjack was born.

After our game we decided to think about new rules for our new variant of Blackjack, like jokers.
