## Grayjack Rules

## How Grayjack was born
It all started 175 years ago, in Le Grand Cercle casino in France. No actually it was just a regular tuesday noon at school on the 24th of june 2025.

I was playing Blackjack with a friend and he came up with a rule, you can see your cards during the betting phase. I found this idea amazing and we played with it.

A few hands later I was in bad posture and decided to fold, and I came up with another rule, you can only fold once per game, not per hand, to prevent abusing folding.

At this very moment, the idea of Grayjack was born.

After our game we decided to think about new rules for our new variant of Blackjack, like jokers.
